#+DESCRIPTION: A library of numerical methods coded in Fortran and Python
#+KEYWORDS: python, julia, fortran, math, numerical methods

* Introduction
  This is a combination of numerical methods coded in Fortran, Python, and
  Julia.

** Files
   - ~old~ :: Directory of old code
   - ~src~ :: Directory of code ported to Julia
* Usage
  Right now the code is setup as modules in ~src/modules~, you can port the code
  into your ~Julia~ code with the following commands.
  #+BEGIN_SRC julia
    # evalutes the code in the file
    include("path/to/file.jl")

    # loads the module for direct use
    using .Module
  #+END_SRC
